# Token benchmark

The same 6 tasks are implemented idiomatically in SSP-T, Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and C++. Token counts are measured with real tokenizers. Results are in `RESULTS.md`.

```
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install tiktoken
.venv/bin/python bench.py
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... .venv/bin/python bench.py
```

The second form also counts with Claude's tokenizer, via the count_tokens API (set `SSPUR_CLAUDE_MODEL` to override the model). The script exits non-zero if SSP-T's median ratio vs Python is 1.0 or higher, so it can serve as a regression gate in CI.

## Tasks

| Task | What it tests |
|---|---|
| 1_word_freq | Collections pipeline |
| 2_order_logic | Types, validation, errors, injected storage |
| 3_retry_fetch | Network, timeouts, retry with backoff, decoding |
| 4_parallel_combine | Structured concurrency |
| 5_crud_service_infra | Handler plus infrastructure plus least-privilege IAM (Python and TypeScript include CDK) |
| 6_ring_buffer | Systems code: generics, const capacity, ownership |

## Rules

- No comments in any language.
- Each sample is idiomatic for its language, using common libraries (httpx, reqwest, cpr, errgroup, CDK).
- SSP-T samples include their contracts and effect rows, even though they cost tokens. The other languages carry no equivalent guarantees.

## Caveats

1. **SSP-T samples are hand-written and unverified.** No compiler exists yet. The numbers will be re-measured once Phase 2 can typecheck them.
2. The samples were written by the language's designer, so they're biased. Phase 2 adds model-written samples produced from the spec alone.
3. Some savings come from moving checks into types (`where _ > 0` replaces runtime validation and its error variants). That's intended, but it means token savings and safety gains can't be separated in these numbers.
4. Token count per file is a proxy. The real metric is **tokens per correct change** in agent sessions, which Phase 3 measures.

## Findings (Phase 1)

- SSP-T median is 0.71x Python on both tokenizers (geometric mean 0.65x). C++ is 1.68x and Rust is 1.43x.
- The largest gain is infrastructure (0.30x): deployment, IAM, and validation are derived instead of written.
- **Weakest case is systems code** (ring buffer, 0.98x, which loses to TypeScript and Go). Generic parameters `[T, N]` repeat on every function. Candidate fix: an `on Ring[T, N]` block that scopes shared type params. That needs an ADR and a re-measurement.
- o200k and cl100k agree within 2%, so the gains are syntax-driven, not tokenizer-specific.
