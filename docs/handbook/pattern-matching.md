# Pattern Matching

`match e` is followed by arms, one per line: `| pattern => value`. Arms are tried from the top. Every arm has the same type, which is the type of the whole `match`.

## Patterns and guards

```sspur
{{#include ../snippets/handbook/matching.ssp:guards}}
```

- `Circle{r}` binds the field `r`. `Rect{w: width}` binds the field `w` to the name `width`. Fields you don't name are ignored, and a bare `Circle` ignores all of them.
- `if` after a pattern is a guard. The arm only matches when the guard is true.
- `_` matches anything and binds nothing.

## Tuples, literals and options

Matching on a tuple checks several values at once, and literals match themselves. `some(p)`, `none`, `ok(p)` and `err(p)` take apart `Opt` and `Res`:

```sspur
{{#include ../snippets/handbook/matching.ssp:values}}
```

## Or-patterns

`p1 | p2` matches when either alternative does, so cases that share an arm are written once. Alternatives nest anywhere a pattern goes, `some(0 | 1)` or `(Red | Blue, _)`:

```sspur
{{#include ../snippets/handbook/matching.ssp:or}}
```

Every alternative has to bind the same names with the same types: `| Circle{r} | Rect{w} => r` is `E_PATTERN_OR_BINDS`, because `r` would be unbound when a `Rect` matched.

## Lists

`[]`, `[x]` and `[x, y]` match lists of exactly that length. `..` matches any number of elements, and `..rest` binds them as a list, at the start, the end or in the middle: `[x, ..rest]`, `[..init, last]`, `[first, .., last]`. The elements are patterns themselves, so literals, tuples and constructors work inside:

```sspur
{{#include ../snippets/handbook/matching.ssp:lists}}
```

`[]` and `[x, ..rest]` together cover every list. In native code `rest` is a view of the same list, so walking a list this way copies nothing.

## One case: `if e is p`

When only one case matters, `if e is p then a else b` tests it without a full `match`. The names the pattern binds are in scope in the `then` branch, and `and` after the pattern adds a condition that can use them:

```sspur
{{#include ../snippets/handbook/matching.ssp:is}}
```

`else` can be left out when the `then` branch is `Unit`, and tests chain with `else if e2 is q then`. Code written as `if let some(p) = e then` is stored as `if e is some(p) then`.

## Exhaustiveness

A `match` has to cover every case. If it doesn't, the program doesn't compile, and the error names the missing case:

```sspur
{{#include ../snippets/handbook/missing.ssp}}
```

```console
{{#include ../snippets/handbook/matching.out:missing}}
```

This is why adding a variant to a sum type is safe: the checker lists every `match` that needs a new arm. The check looks inside nested patterns and lists too, so the missing case can be `some(none)` or `[_]`, and an arm that the arms above already cover gets the warning `W_ARM_UNREACHABLE`.

One thing to watch: an arm's value runs to the end of the arm, so a `match` nested inside an arm would take every arm below it. Put the inner `match` in a helper function.

## Decision tables

Business rules often look like a table: a few inputs, many cases, first match wins. `rule` writes them that way. Each row has one cell per parameter, and a cell is `_`, a pattern, or a condition on that parameter:

```sspur
{{#include ../snippets/handbook/matching.ssp:rule}}
```

The checker treats a rule like a `match`. It reports inputs that match no row (`E_RULE_GAP`, with examples, as in the second error above) and rows that can never fire because earlier rows cover them (`E_RULE_SHADOWED`).

```console
{{#include ../snippets/handbook/matching.out:1:2}}
```
