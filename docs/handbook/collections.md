# Collections and Pipelines

Collections are values. Every method returns a new collection and leaves the old one alone, and the native compiler reuses memory in place when nothing else can see the old value, so this costs less than it sounds.

## Pipelines

Most list code is a chain of methods, each taking a lambda:

```sspur
{{#include ../snippets/handbook/collections.ssp:pipeline}}
```

`group_by` gives `(key, items)` pairs in first-seen order. `sort_by` takes a key; a tuple key sorts by several fields, and negating a number sorts it descending. A chain can't continue on the next line, so bind the middle step to a name as above.

```console
{{#include ../snippets/handbook/collections.out}}
```

## Lists

```sspur
{{#include ../snippets/handbook/collections.ssp:list}}
```

The methods you will use most are `map filter fold sum len sort sort_by find any all first last take drop contains unique enumerate zip join group_by counts partition windows chunks`. Methods that may find nothing, like `find`, `first` and `index_of`, return an `Opt`. A `List` is also a deque: `push`, `push_front`, `pop_front` and `pop_back` are amortized O(1) in native code. The [collections reference](../reference/stdlib/collections.md) lists every method.

## Maps and sets

`Map` and `Set` are ordered and persistent: `put` and `add` return a new map or set. `HashMap` and `HashSet` have the same methods with hashing, and print in key order.

```sspur
{{#include ../snippets/handbook/collections.ssp:maps}}
```

## Loops and ranges

`for` works over lists, ranges and generators, and a `for` pattern can take a tuple apart. `a..b` excludes `b`; `range(start, end, step)` counts by any step, including down. `str_buf()` builds a string in amortized O(1) per append.

```sspur
{{#include ../snippets/handbook/collections.ssp:loops}}
```

Loops over ranges, and `map`, `filter` and `sum` chains over them, run natively without building the list. Pure pipelines over large lists are also split across cores automatically, which [Concurrency](concurrency.md) explains. Next: [Concurrency](concurrency.md).
