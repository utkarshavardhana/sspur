# Error codes

Every diagnostic has a code. `E_` is an error, `W_` a warning and `A_` an audit note that records something you asked for on purpose. Most errors also print a `hint:` line with the exact fix, and `sspur check --json` carries `fix` ops that an agent can apply as they are (see the [diagnostic schema](schema.md)).

This page lists every code the compiler can emit, grouped by area. The test suite compares it with the compiler's source, so a new code can't ship without a row here.
